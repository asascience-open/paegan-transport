Paegan-Transport
================

The parallelized Lagrangian transport model for NetCDF/OPeNDAP data, written on top of [Paegan](https://github.com/asascience-open/paegan)


Setup
------------------
You are using `virtualenv`, right?

1. Install [virtualenv-burrito](https://github.com/brainsik/virtualenv-burrito)
2. Create virtualenv named "paegan-transport-dev": `mkvirtualenv -p your_python_binary paegan-transport-dev`
3. Start using your new virtualenv: `workon paegan-transport-dev`


Installation
-------------
Paegan-Transport requires python 2.7.x and is available on PyPI.

The best way to install Paegan-Transport is through pip:

```bash
pip install paegan-transport
```

Paegan-Transport requires the following python libraries which will be downloaded and installed through `pip`:

* GDAL==1.9.1
* Fiona==0.8
* paegan==0.9.9
* requests==1.2.3

See the [Paegan](https://github.com/asascience-open/paegan) documentation for installing other dependencies related to Paegan.


Roadmap
--------
* More behaviors


Troubleshooting
---------------
If you are having trouble getting any of the paegan functionality to work, try running the tests:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:asascience-open/paegan-transport.git`
cd paegan-transport
pip install pytest
python -m pytest -s
```

If you want to run the model_controller or shoreline tests, you will need to edit the test files with paths appropriate for your system. Default is `/data/lm` with `/data/lm/bathy` and `/data/lm/shore` filled in with the files below.

Some tests require large files that are not in source control.  You can get them here:
* ETOPO1 Global Bathymetry ([ETOPO1_Bed_g_gmt4.grd](http://s3.amazonaws.com/paegan/resources/ETOPO1_Bed_g_gmt4.grd))
* Shoreline files (unzip) ([shore.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/paegan/resources/shore.zip))
